Other sprites so far include a full Link sheet, and some additions made by Tony (Knightcrawler) as a start to Links new actions. These include sword spin (level 1-3) sprites, and wall jump sprites. Wall Jump is on the Link/.bmp sheet with all of links normal movements. The sword charging and sword slashing sheets are seperate because of the sheer number of sprites.

Spin Slash level 1-3 are new moves unique to the Enhanced Quest, they are learned from secret teachers
Wall Jump is unique the the Enhanced Quest.
