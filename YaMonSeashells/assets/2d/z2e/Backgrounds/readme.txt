All files are 320x240 resolution, they may need some graphical clearning up of blemishes if the game is to run at full screen because they will be zoomed in. The 'normal' ones are meant to be placed in areas of like on the west continent, the 'twilight' variations are for use on the east continent, because of the fire being blown out of the volcanic area to the south ;)

The palace Backgrounds are meant for the far background, each palace will have 3 layers at least, background, columns (which are included in the tileset for the palace), player layer (includes link, enemies, and tiles) and possibly a front layer but it hasn't been discussed as yet. The backgrounds will scroll at differing speeds.
