The title screen works in the same way as the classic. The game title font rises slowly from behind the sword/foreground, and in front of the water/background. Until it stops at the top. After a delay the 'press start button' in the OOA font appears. If you leave it, after a longer delay, the title scrolls off the top and the story in OOA font scrolls up. Then repeats to the start after it finishes.

At the bottom corner of the screen, a '(c) Nintendo, 1986' will be listed followed by a 'Gaming Universe presents' tag.

The start button (whatever the player has mapped it as anyways) progresses to the Game Select screen.

All graphics for the title excluding the OOA font have been stored in the Game Mechanics folder.
