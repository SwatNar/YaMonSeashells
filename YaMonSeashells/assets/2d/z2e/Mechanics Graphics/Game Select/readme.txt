The Game select screen works in a similar way to the original version, as yet no 'naming screen' has been mocked or programmed so I'll only detail the main select screen. 

In the center of the screen is the 'box' with the info, the outside of the box is made up of the games status screen border graphics. With the inside a fill of grey. The enhanced Faerie icon is used as a cursor to select game, with the Link icon representing files that can be opened. Next is the name of the character in the OoA font included with the game mechanics. Next comes the Life, Magic, Attack icons. A new addition to the Enhanced Quest.

Under the icons is an extra icon for each one representing the power level currently in the listed games. The 'I' to 'IX' icons are included in the Gameselect.bmp file, and the HUD.bmp file as they will also appear on the hud in game. Next is the Exp guage. Another new addition. This guage will fill as you kill enemies as opposed to the numerical counter of the classic quest. All the graphics for this are included. Underneath is the crystal slots. 6 black diamonds which will be replaced by the gold ones when a crystal is returned to a Palace. To guage your progress by looking at the game select.

The Background of this screen is a simple scrolling background which will be taken at random from the backgrounds folder, so a different one loads up every time the screen loads. Music for this screen is undecided but maybe use the 'game select' music from the N64/GCN games.

At the bottom of the screen will be button codes (not graphically done yet) whioch will tell you what to press (like an 'A' button icon and font saying 'select game' and a 'B' icon with font saying 'delete' etc) Since we're basing the graphical capablities off the SNES it will pay good homage to use SNES button icons.

I've included a basic mockup of the final screen (minus the button codes) for reference
